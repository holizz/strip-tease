= strip-tease

Put an image in image.jpg, run ruby tease.rb, and subsequent refreshes of the
page will progressively de-pixelate the image until it's at 100% quality.

Note: using the vanilla im_magick gem erroneously aliases scale to resize
meaning the image would instead be blurred. I have a patched repo:
